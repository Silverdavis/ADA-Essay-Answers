My interest in programming coincides with my interest in ADA Developers Academy. It started as a conversation with a friend. I was remarking how Seattle has become unbelievably expensive and that, though I love my job, I don't make nearly enough to survive here. My friend said, "so its simple, work for Boeing, Microsoft or Amazon". I laughed at how casually she'd suggested a total career change that would take at least four years of re education but then she told me about ADA's bootcamp style learning and my interested was peaked. I did some research on coding and started the Jumpstart learning program. I recognized that I had encountered HTML ages ago through Myspace and a little Javascript when using Wix to help me build a website for my dog running business. As I continued with the Jumpstart and many, many Youtube tutorials on coding, I grew increasingly excited about what I was learning. I love the puzzle solving aspect of coding and the feeling of accomplishment when something actually works. Other than Myspace, Wix and the jumpstart course provided by ADA my only other coding exposure is the Youtube videos I've watched on the subject.
